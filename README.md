**Personalized Promotion Engine** - An AI system that predicts which customers will buy specific products and generates targeted promotion campaigns.

## 💡 What happens in this promotion engine

**Traditional Way (Many supermarket systems current approach):**

```
Bread is 15% off
→ Send SMS to ALL 10,000 customers
→ Only 500 buy bread
→ Wasted: 9,500 SMS, discounts to customers who won't buy
```

**Proposed promotion engine AI Way:**

```
Bread is 15% off
→ AI analyzes: Who buys bread regularly?
→ Finds 1,000 most likely customers
→ Only send to these 1,000
→ 400 buy bread (40% conversion vs 5%)
→ Saved: 9,000 SMS, no wasted discounts
```

### How Does My AI Work?

**Step 1: Learn Patterns**

```
AI looks at past data:
- Customer A buys bread every week
- Customer B never bought bread
- Customer C bought bread when discounted
```

**Step 2: Predict Future**

```
New bread promotion:
- Customer A: 90% will buy (high priority)
- Customer B: 5% will buy (skip)
- Customer C: 60% if discount >15% (target with 20% discount)
```

**Step 3: Optimize**

```
 system decides:
- Who to target (top 1000)
- What discount to give each (5-25% personalized)
- When to send (morning vs evening)
- What to bundle (bread + butter)
```

- **Recall@100**: ~0.45 (find 45% of potential buyers)
- **ROC AUC**: ~0.75-0.80 (good discrimination)

## 📌 PROBLEM SOLVED

**Before (Traditional):**

```
Store wants to promote Bread
    ↓
Send 10% discount email to ALL 1000 customers
    ↓
Only 100 customers buy (10% conversion)
    ↓
Wasted 900 emails, high marketing cost
```

**After (My AI Solution):**

```
Store wants to promote Bread
    ↓
AI analyzes customer data → Predicts who will buy
    ↓
Send 10% discount email to only 50 targeted customers
    ↓
12-13 customers buy (25% conversion)
    ↓
Same sales, 75% cost reduction!
```
